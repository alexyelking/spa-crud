## SPA application with REST API implementation
The application allows you to create records that are essentially records of ticket purchases to any entertainment institution (cinema / water park / Disneyland / shooting gallery, etc.) with pre-determined prices for various categories of citizens (regular ticket, student ticket, pensioner ticket).
After calculating the total amount of ticket purchases, a record is created that can be edited, viewed or deleted.
All this is done using SPA technology, all information is updated on the fly without refreshing the page.
